### What we accomplished and what trouble we ran into
We added an array of games, them being flappy bird, a driving game, mine sweeper, and tetris. We did all this by getting does from the internet and would ask Chat GPT to improve the code in which it would give a short explanation on how the code was improved and the actual code itself. An example of that would be "In this updated code, I've added a percent5 property to each AP class object, representing the percentage of people who scored a 5 on the AP exam for that class. The table now includes a column for this information. You can adjust the percentages as needed for each class." We also added a table with Jquerey about the hardest AP classes on a scal from 1-5 (1 being least hardest and 5 being the most hard).
