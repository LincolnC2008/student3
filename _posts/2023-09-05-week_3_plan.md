#### Plan for the week
Make a plan on what to do for the week on Github and ask Jared's pair for feedback on our plan either in person or in slack, mainly questions that will trigger feedback on my Github plan. Start building or working on projects mainly being a table about using JS output Jquery and the table will be about the best Star Wars characters. The games I will add will be the game of life and then a shooter game by asking chat gpt for that code with a prompt like "Give me html code for a shooter game". I will work on my calculator by adding colors and making the buttons look better by using code provided by either the teachers or chat gpt. Work with Ishan to make the shooter game and calculator. Sign up for pair show case which we will probably sign up for Friday or Monday. Plan pair showcase and review code by rehersing what we will say. Add a review as well to talk about what we did in the week.
