### Summary of Accomplishments and troubles I had
> I made one update to my index.md at the begining of the week where I added snake game from code I found online. I also later in the week made another snake game and added to my hacks. I also made another repo for the new template of the website, I started changing the theme, and adding to this blog page. I also made an IPYNB which I am trying to add a calculator too. I had also finished downloading everything from week 0-2. I encountered problems with making a calculator That I am still figuring out, I encountered problems when changing the themes of the website because the images kept on enlarging so to fix that I looked up other themes that were not listed under the different themes in VS Code that did not enlarge all the images. I also had trouble adding to the posts section because I added spaces in the name of the post file which you are not meant to do, but instead add dashes and underscores.
