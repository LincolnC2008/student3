## Summary of acomplishemnets and problems I encountered
During the 1st couple days of class I had aquired a windows computer and downloaded WSL and VS Code. I had read most of the stuff in week 0 and I had made a github and slack account. I had encountered problems at the very start and a major problem being how I had not installed WSL Ubuuntu properly, WSL kept showing up with "root" so as a result I had to restart everything and reinstall the whole thing again. I am not certain, but I think the problem was when I made my username as I put the wrong one so I tried uninstalling, but I did not uninstall all the way so I looked up videos for help over the weekend until I eventually got it working.
