    "- I made the entire front page of our website, with the exception of the background, the rain animation, and the clickabke frog that jumps across the screen when you click it. I made the image buttons through an href function and an onclick event which is pretty much the whole home page. \n",
    "- I did all the main.py in the backend which was key for linking the frontend and the backend becasue if main.py did not work, the backend site would not run, and the api connection would be impossible.  This code sets up routes for different web addresses, defines functions to handle those addresses, and prepares some tasks before the first request is processed.\n",
    "- I myself also did the api connection on frontend and backend. I did this through seperate .md files for each frog, and I figured out a way to seperate the data of each frog because the backend website contained all the info on all the frogs so.\n",
    "- I also worked of frogs.py which is a model in the backend, this held all the data for the frogs in a db. This db was based on the frog species class I made."

    "# Data Abstraction\n",
    "1. Definition:\n",
    "- Data abstraction is a programming concept that focuses on hiding the implementation details of data types or objects and exposing only the essential characteristics or behavior.\n",
    "2. Purpose:\n",
    "- The primary goal of data abstraction is to simplify complex systems by allowing users to interact with data at a higher level of abstraction, without needing to understand the underlying complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Encapsulation is a key aspect of data abstraction. It involves bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data together in a single unit, often called a class or an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Access Control:\n",
    "- Data abstraction provides a way to control access to the internal state of an object. It allows certain attributes or methods to be accessible while keeping others private.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interface:\n",
    "- The interface of an object defines the set of methods that can be used to interact with it. It describes what operations are available without revealing how they are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Black Box Approach:\n",
    "- Data abstraction follows a \"black box\" approach, where users are only concerned with what an object does, not how it does it. This promotes modularity and reduces the complexity of using objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Levels of Abstraction:\n",
    "- Abstraction can be achieved at different levels. For example, high-level programming languages abstract away low-level machine code operations, allowing programmers to focus on algorithmic logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Reusability:\n",
    "- Data abstraction promotes code reuse. Once an abstract data type or class is defined, it can be used in various contexts without the need to understand its internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Separation of Concerns:\n",
    "- Data abstraction helps in separating the concerns of different parts of a program. This makes it easier to manage, test, and maintain complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Polymorphism:\n",
    "- Abstraction allows for polymorphism, where objects of different types can be used interchangeably if they share a common interface. This promotes flexibility in code design.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Real-world Analogy:\n",
    "- A real-world analogy of data abstraction can be seen in a car. A driver interacts with the car using controls like the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift, without needing to understand the internal combustion engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Example:\n",
    "- In object-oriented programming, a class that represents a bank account can abstract away the details of how the account balance is managed, providing methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and get_balance() for interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithims\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Characteristics:\n",
    "- Input: Algorithms take some input(s) and produce an output.\n",
    "- Definiteness: Each step in the algorithm must be precisely defined and unambiguous.\n",
    "- Finiteness: The algorithm must eventually terminate after a finite number of steps.\n",
    "- Effectiveness: Each step must be achievable using basic operations that can be carried out by a human or a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Efficiency:\n",
    "- An important aspect of algorithms is their efficiency, which refers to how quickly they can produce a solution. This is often measured in terms of time complexity (how long it takes to run) and space complexity (how much memory it uses).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Correctness:\n",
    "- An algorithm is considered correct if it produces the expected output for all valid inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic:\n",
    "- Deterministic algorithms produce the same output for the same input every time they are executed.\n",
    "- Non-deterministic algorithms may produce different outputs for the same input, depending on factors like randomization or external conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Algorithmic Paradigms:\n",
    "- There are various approaches to designing algorithms, including:\n",
    "    - Divide and Conquer: Break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them, and combine the results.\n",
    "    - Greedy Algorithms: Make locally optimal choices at each step to find a global optimum.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Programming: Solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "    - Backtracking: Incrementally build a solution, backtracking when it becomes clear that it cannot be completed.\n",
    "    - Brute Force: Consider all possible solutions to a problem and select the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Applications:\n",
    "- Algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, from sorting and searching data to optimizing routes in GPS systems, cryptography, image processing, and artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Algorithmic Complexity Classes:\n",
    "- Algorithms are often categorized based on their time and space complexity. Common notations include Big O notation (O()), which describes an upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Algorithm Analysis:\n",
    "- Evaluating and comparing algorithms involves considering factors like time complexity, space complexity, and their performance characteristics in different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Iterative vs. Recursive:\n",
    "- Algorithms can be implemented using iteration (loops) or recursion (a function calling itself). Both approaches have their strengths and trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simmulations\n",
